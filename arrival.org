 - It is not a typical sci-fi movie where some aliens arrive at the Earth to
   conquer us with an antropical shape. It is a sci-fi film that didn't end
   with a massive, non-consequential space, robot or monster battle.

 - It shows a realistic situation where some aliens arrive and we need to
   decode the basics of their language in order to communicate with them.

 - “If you could see your whole life laid out in front of you, would you change
   things?” she asks her future husband Ian Donnelly. Put another way, would
   you rob someone of their existence, and yourself of the time shared with
   them on Earth, if you knew they would one day would feel pain, and you would
   feel their loss?

 - The language we speak affects how our brain works

 - We as humans are made of our memories and defined by our choices

 - Arrival isn’t about time travel. It’s also not a commentary on
   gene-modification, abortion, or any other hot-button topic about using our
   foresight into the future to force our present path to diverge. It’s about
   acceptance, understanding our life’s choices, and living as if any one
   moment were as valuable or meaningful as the next.

#+BEGIN_NOTES
After aliens land at twelve sites across the world, respected linguist Louise
Banks is recruited to decipher their language and uncover the purpose of their
arrival. As Louise immerses herself in their language, she gains the ability to
experience time non-linearly, allowing her to see her future. Eventually, she
can understand the real reason why the aliens came, which profoundly changes
the world forever.

It is not a typical sci-fi movie where some aliens arrive at the Earth to
conquer us with an antropical shape. It is a sci-fi film that didn't end with a
massive, non-consequential space, robot or monster battle.

https://comicsverse.com/arrival-female-character/

She is not the typical female character with male character. He was a strong
female character because she was not intended to be one. She was not always
strong. She was herself.
We see what she is made of in the first two minutes of the film

She pushes herself to the limits, even if she feels weak or too scared.

And despite knowing her baby will die and her husband will leave her, she
musters the strength to choose happiness, even if it is limited.

And she is a brilliant academist, with a prestigious position.
