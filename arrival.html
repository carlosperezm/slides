After aliens land at twelve sites across the world, respected linguist Louise
Banks is recruited to decipher their language and uncover the purpose of their
arrival. As Louise immerses herself in their language, she gains the ability to
experience time non-linearly, allowing her to see her future. Eventually, she
can understand the real reason why the aliens came, which profoundly changes
the world forever.
</p>

<p>
It is not a typical sci-fi movie where some aliens arrive at the Earth to
conquer us with an antropical shape. It is a sci-fi film that didn't end with a
massive, non-consequential space, robot or monster battle.

She asks her future husband Ian Donnelly. Put another way, would you rob
someone of their existence, and yourself of the time shared with them on Earth,
if you knew they would one day would feel pain, and you would feel their loss?

</p>

<p>
She is not the typical female character with male character. He was a strong
female character because she was not intended to be one. She was not always
strong. She was herself.
We see what she is made of in the first two minutes of the film
</p>

<p>
She pushes herself to the limits, even if she feels weak or too scared.
</p>

<p>
And despite knowing her baby will die and her husband will leave her, she
musters the strength to choose happiness, even if it is limited.
</p>

<p>
And she is a brilliant academist, with a prestigious position.
